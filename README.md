# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques and Building a Simple Recommender System

Fatemeh Shariat, Azade Parvizi October 2020

In this paper we are trying to build a Machin learning model to predict house prices and then we try to build a recommender system for house buyers. We will use Ames dataset that contains information of houses and their different features provided by De Cock at http://www.kaggle.com/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset.
Then we will be programming in Python using these packages: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm.
Machine learning methods used: Lasso, ElasticNet, KernelRidge, Decision Tree, XGBoostRegression, RandomForest.
