# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques and Building a Simple Recommender System

Fatemeh Shariat, Azade Parvizi October 2020

House pricing is an important topic that worries most people, because we can never predict exact prices according to neighborhood and facilities.
In this paper we are trying to build a Machin learning model to predict house prices and then we try to build a recommender system for house buyers. We will use Ames dataset that contains information of houses and their different features and we will use Python programming language with a number of Python packages.

for viewing the project you have to run the "HousePricing" file!
